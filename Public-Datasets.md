# Public Datasets
To help using Gosling for the first time, we provide several datasets to start with.

In Gosling, two different types of datasets are allowed to use for flexible data exploration: 
1. Datasets that does not require any preprocessing and a dedicated server (i.e., HiGlass server) 
2. Scalable datasets that need the server which are precomputing so that scalable data exploration is enabled

In this document, we provide a list of datasets in the two aforementioned types.
