# Public Datasets
To help using Gosling for the first time, we provide useful public datasets to start with.

For the flexible data exploration, Gosling supports two sets of data:
1. Datasets that does not require any preprocessing and a dedicated server (i.e., HiGlass server) 
2. Scalable datasets that need the server which are precomputing so that scalable data exploration is enabled

In this document, we provide a list of datasets in the two aforementioned types.

> **Tip.** When you are using online editor, you can check out a "Data Preview" panel on the right-bottom part of the interface to see how the actual values look like.
