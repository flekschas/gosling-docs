# Public Datasets
To help using Gosling for the first time, we provide useful public datasets to start with.

For the flexible data exploration, Gosling supports two different kinds of datasets:
1. **Plain datasets**: For the convenience, we support directly using files without requiring to preprocess data or using a dedicated server (i.e., HiGlass server). 
<!--This includes BigWig, BED, BEDPE, and we will be supporting more genomic file formats in the near future.-->
2. **Scalable datasets**: To allow scalable data exploration, we also support using precomputed datasets which requires the dedicated server.

In this document, we provide a list of datasets in the two aforementioned types.

> **Tip.** When you are using online editor, you can check out a "Data Preview" panel on the right-bottom part of the interface to see how the actual values look like.
